# ChessEngineV2

ChessEngineV2 is not only an improvement from [ChessEngine](https://github.com/lukasvozenilek/ChessEngine), but a complete redesign from the ground up using Unity and C#. Switching to C# from Python yielded an extrordinary performance increase leading to a significantly higher search depth. This produced a formidable opponent that is fun to play against. The switch to Unity also allowed for a proper GUI to be developed making it a lot more easier to play against than the previous version's command line interface.
